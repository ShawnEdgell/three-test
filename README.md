# Three.js Interactive 3D Scene

## Overview
This project is a simple but interactive 3D scene built using Three.js. It showcases basic features of Three.js, including creating 3D geometries, adding lighting, and enabling user interaction.

## Features
- **Interactive 3D Objects**: The scene contains a cube, a sphere, and a torus, each of which can change color upon mouse click.
- **Animations**: The cube and torus rotate continuously, while the sphere has a bouncing animation.
- **Responsive Design**: The scene adjusts to the browser window's size.
- **Lighting**: Basic ambient and point lighting are included to enhance the visuals.

## Setup
To run this project locally, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `index.html` file in a modern web browser.
3. Click on the 3D objects to change their colors. Observe the animations and responsive behavior.

## Technologies Used
- HTML
- JavaScript
- Three.js (WebGL)

## Possible Enhancements
- Implement advanced animations and transitions.
- Add more interactive elements and complex geometries.
- Integrate physics for realistic object behavior.
- Add a user interface for controlling scene parameters.
